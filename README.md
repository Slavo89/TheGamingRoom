# TheGamingRoom

This is my amateur project created for learning purposes, inspired by the Epic Games Store. The project was developed using React and various additional libraries and tools.

The application utilizes the main API provided by RAWG.io for fetching game data. This API was slightly customized to include game prices based on Metacritic scores.

Unfortunately, due to limitations in the API data provided, the project does not include different image resolutions. This limitation affected the functionality of the project.

## Features

- Browsing available games
- Detailed game information
- Adding games to the cart
- Simple checkout process
- Wishlist functionality
- User authentication and login
  
## Used Technologies and Libraries

- React Router DOM (for view navigation)
- Axios (for making HTTP requests)
- Swiper (for creating main page carousel slide shows with better performance)
- Slick (for Browse Page slider)
- React Select (for creating interactive dropdown lists)
- React-Responsive Carousel (for displaying image carousels)
- Focus Trap React (for handling focus trapping on elements)
